          I'm currently a Sophomore (though, only I only have a handful of days left with that.) Within Multimedia, my strongest skillset is graphic design, though I've been learning Blender as a personal passion. I pride myself on being able to learn quickly, so I've been able to gain familiarity with various tools and programs. I should admit, my passion is not with Multimedia, but instead with information technology. (hence me making this website with HTML, CSS, and Javascript instead of tools we've learned such as Google Sites) Despite that, this program has been a great learning experience, and has given me skills that I'll definetely be using in the future.
