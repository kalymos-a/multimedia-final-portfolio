          <p class="imagetext">This is an older project, in which we translated a image into a low-poly version. I didn't make the original image, but did make the image look low-poly. This was made entierly with Adobe Illustrator. This has been one of my favourite projects I've worked on throughout the project. </p>

          <p class="imagetext">In this project, we were instructed to create branding for a restaurant that those in the Culinary program were creating. This had us working with the folks in Culinary so that we understood their brand. For this project, I mainly used Adobe Illustrator, along with other tools like Adobe Fonts and Adobe Color. This taught me a lot about making logos, with this being my favourite one I've made so far.</p>

          <p class="imagetext">The goal here was to create an intro animation for a fictional production company. While we were instructed to use a tutorial for this project, I made many changes to my project outside of the tutorial to make it look even better. This is the project that got me into Blender, when making this project I had a ton of fun with Blender's shader node system, and went home to play around with it more. While that aspect is still my favorite part of Blender, I've been really enjoying other aspects of Blender, mainly modeling.</p>
